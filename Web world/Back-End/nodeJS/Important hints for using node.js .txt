- In node js there is no such thing as copy,
    Meaning that when you copy an object, you are actually sharing the object and not copying it,
    i.e when you assign a value to an object copied from another object,
    the same value will be assigned to the other object as well,
    this happens when doing any assign in node.js, not just for the object,
    and it's called data sharing.
    


- In node js, it is better to use the .forEach() function to pass all the items of the arrays.
